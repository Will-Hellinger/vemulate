# Vemulate
This project is currently in development, and as such, it is important to note that things are subject to change.

## What is this?

Vemulate is a compatability library designed to take in python code meant for a VEX V5 brain and intercept it allowing for computers to simulate what the brain would do.

## How is this useful?

VEX V5 brains are exepensive and although this isnt a 1:1 copy, it's a good place to test code if you dont have a brain available.

### What Works:

- Basic motor control
- Sensor input
- LCD display
- Button input
- LED control


### What Doesnt Work:

- A simulated version of the remote control
- Interactions with other devices


### In Progress:
- code restructure to allow for easier importing
